# INN Hotels
In this project, I analyze the data of INN Hotels to find which factors have a high influence on booking cancellations, build a predictive model that can predict which booking is going to be canceled in advance, and help in formulating profitable policies for cancellations and refunds.

### About Me
I'm Seyi, and there’s absolutely nothing I love more than using data driven strategies for problem-solving in businesses! 

 I’m a skilled Data scientist and analyst passionate about transforming, exploring and extracting useful and actionable insights from data,creating compelling visuals and reports, and bringing the data to life through storytelling that will inspire the change that needs to happen for businesses to maximize their success.

Using Python, I explore data and perform statistical analysis such as A/B testing, and create machine learning models using supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms, depending on the problems to be solved.

I’m proficient in using Python, SQL (intermediate), Microsoft excel, Microsoft power BI and Tableau. I never stop improving on my existing skills, while i'm picking up more skills that are useful

I use Python Libraries regularly to explore data, perform statistical analysis such as A/B testing and build machine learning models (supervised and unsupervised). My most frequently used libraries include Pandas, numpy, matplotlib, plotly, scikit learn and scipy.stats.
